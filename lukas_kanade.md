It will yield a good result.

The assumptions are fulfilled.
The assumptions are not fulfilled.



### Good
The brightness constancy assumption and the constant motion in a neighborhood assumption are fulfilled. The neighborhood contains sufficient structure to avoid the aperture problem.

### Constant Motion

TODO: why
Constant motion in a neighborhood assumption is violated.

### Uniform color/aperture problem
TODO what:
is uniformly colored and thus the aperture problem arises.

### Brightness constancy

has a non-Lambertian surface and thus

has a very specular (mirror-like) surface, hence the view point change leads to 

the brightness constancy assumptionis violated.  because the view point changes

### Eigenvalues
both over 0 --> x lies on corner
both near zero --> x lies in unstructured region
one near zero, one over 0 --> x lies on edge

### Aperture Problem

The aperture problem states that it is impossible to determine the motion orthogonal to
the gradient direction in regions with constant gradient direction. M not being invertible
means that there is no unique solution b, which is the mathematical formulation of “the motion cannot be determined”.

If the gradient directiron is constant in W(x) for a scalar function \alpha and a 2D vector u, M is not invertible.
